# Hey, everybody!
It's Hey Day, which means it's a great day to say "hey!"

Hey Day is an Auburn University tradition established in 1947 where members of the Auburn family wear name tags and say "hey" to one other. The tradition's goal is to help foster a friendly environment on campus and encourage a sense of community here in Auburn. This year, virtual events are taking place, and this script is a part of that. By running the attached heyday.sh script in your terminal, you can experience this Auburn tradition digitally, no matter where you are.
